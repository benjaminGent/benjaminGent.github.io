It is the most common type II superconductor. It is relatively easy to synthesize, and therefore, it is a perfect example for the conventional use. If you want to experiment with it, there are multiple websites that offer worldwide delivery.

However, I highly recomend making one on your own. For these purposes you should follow this investigation that I consider the easiest to follow, yet the most effective one.

While I was synthesized this superconductor I faced several challenges due to lack of detail in the investigation. That is why I created an itemized video tutorial for non-technical begginers who just discovered the beauty of superconductivity.
