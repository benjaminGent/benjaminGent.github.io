High critical temperature (Tc) caused a massive impact on science. Many people were offered to major superconductivity at college. Even my father was regarding this option as a potential direction of his career.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">Johan Prins claimed to have observed a phenomenon that he explained as room-temperature superconductivity within a phase formed on the surface of oxygen-doped type IIa diamonds. From that moment researchers all around the world discovered new materials that were able to superconduct at room temperature. The only downside is that all materials require enourmously high pressure to become a superconductor, which is still a great substitidute to the extremly low temperatures. </p>
